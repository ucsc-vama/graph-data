# Graph Partitioning Hash Function Evaluation

This repository documents the research conducted during an internship collaborating with CITRIS and the Banatao Institute, and VAMA. The primary focus was on identifying the most effective hash function for partitioning various types of graphs, with an emphasis on achieving balanced data distribution across partitions.
